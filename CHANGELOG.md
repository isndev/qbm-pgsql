# Changelog

All notable changes to the qbm-pgsql module are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the module tracks the qb framework's
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Framework-wide policy is in the qb
[VERSIONING](https://github.com/isndev/qb/blob/main/VERSIONING.md) document.

## [Unreleased]

Tracks changes on the development branch not yet part of a tagged release. The module version is
**3.0.0**, in lockstep with the qb framework; see the qb CHANGELOG for what makes that release major.

### Changed

- **`project(qbm-pgsql VERSION ...)` is now `3.0.0`**, tracking `QB_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`. It had been
  left at `2.6.0` while the framework moved on. The module is not standalone-configurable (it calls
  `qb_register_module` / `qb_add_test`, which an installed qb does not ship), so its version can only
  ever mean "the qb this was built against" — and the structural breaks queued for 3.0.0 land hardest
  in the modules, where a package still claiming `2.6.0` would be actively misleading.
- **`scripts/doc-lint.sh` now validates the *value* of the `Verified-against:` markers**, not just
  their presence. It previously checked only that the marker existed, which is how every page in this
  module sat at `qb 2.6.0` across two version bumps unnoticed. The expected version is read from
  `project(qbm-pgsql VERSION ...)` — the one authoritative version available when this repo is checked
  out alone, as it is in its own CI — and cross-checked against `QB_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` whenever a qb
  tree is reachable. A version it cannot determine is a hard stop, never a skip.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-29

Aligned with the qb 2.6.0 framework release.

### Changed

- Test suite restructured into tiered `unit/` / `system/` / `integration/` / `benchmark/` directories.

### Fixed

- Reconnect after a failed transaction no longer surfaces a stale `55P02`.
- Empty `bytea` values round-trip as an empty buffer instead of being decoded as NULL.

### Documentation

- Narrative and reference docs overhauled; every page carries code-verified `src:` citations enforced by
  `scripts/doc-lint.sh`.

## [2.0.0]

Aligns qbm-pgsql with the qb 2.0 framework (C++20 baseline) and hardens the PostgreSQL wire-protocol paths.

### Changed

- Time handling migrated to the canonical chrono model: connect, statement, and transaction timeouts are
  `qb::duration`; the `timestamptz` type maps to `qb::wall_time` (OID 1184, integer-microsecond
  round-tripping). The PostgreSQL wire epoch (microseconds since 2000-01-01, day counts, tz offsets) is kept
  native by design. The retired `qb::Timestamp` / `qb::Duration` types are gone.
- Adapted to the qb C++20 baseline (`QB_CXX_STANDARD=20`, optional 23).

### Fixed

- Uninitialized column count on a malformed `RowDescription`.
- Undefined behavior passing a plain `char` to `std::isspace` / `std::isdigit`.
- `QueryParams` forwarding constructor no longer hijacks copy/move.
- Removed an uncompilable success-only `prepare()` overload and dead, never-compiled tuple-conversion files.
- All queued queries now fail on disconnect, so no coroutine awaiter hangs.
- The connection-deadline timer is owned by the connection and cannot outlive the `Database`.

### Security

- Contain handler exceptions at the `noexcept` `onMessage` boundary (pre-authentication denial-of-service).
- Reject a `PARSE` with more than 32767 parameter types (Bind/Parse symmetry).
- Drop the connection via `not_ok()` on a malformed frame instead of attempting a reconnect.
- Fixed a heap over-read in the timestamp binary decoder for 9–11 byte fields.
